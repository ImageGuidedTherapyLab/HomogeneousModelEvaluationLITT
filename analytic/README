----------------------------------------------------------------------
The makefile compiles and links dakmatlab, an analysis_driver for
DAKOTA that uses MATLAB to evaluate a function expressed in f.m,
possibly using gradients computed by fp.m and Hessians computed by
fpp.m.  When first invoked (e.g., explicitly by "./dakmatlab -s", or
implicitly when used by DAKOTA as an analysis_driver), dakmatlab
starts a copy of itself that talks with MATLAB and talks with the
copies of dakmatlab that DAKOTA invokes over named pipes.  This way,
MATLAB is kept alive, and the large startup cost of invoking MATLAB is
only paid by the initial "dakmatlab -s" invocation.  If shell variable
$DAKMATLAB_PIPE is set to a nonempty value, the named pipes are called
${DAKMATLAB_PIPE}1 and ${MATLAB_PIPE}2, i.e., their names are obtained
by appending "1" and "2" to $DAKMATLAB_PIPE.  If $DAKMATLAB_PIPE is
not set, the named pipes are called dakmatlab_pipe1 and
dakmatlab_pipe2.

When done with the named pipes, invoke

	echo quit >dakmatlab_pipe1

or
	echo quit >${DAKMATLAB_PIPE}1

to make the copy of dakmatlab that talks with MATLAB quit
and remove the named pipes.

To compile and link dakmatlab, you will probably need to adjust one or
more of the "E =", "B =", "L =", and "W =" lines in the makefile to
accord with your system.  It should be clear from looking at the
makefile that $E/extern/include (or, more specifically, $I) should be
the relevant "include" directory provided with your MATLAB
installation, and that $B should be a corresponding directory
containing shared libraries of your MATLAB installation.

DAKOTA input file rosenbrock.in illustrates use of dakmatlab.
Try invoking "dakota rosenbrock.in", possibly after an initial
"./dakmatlab -s".

Invoking

	./dakmatlab --help

causes dakmatlab to print a message about its use.

	./dakmatlab -s
