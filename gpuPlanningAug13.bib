abstract = {Methods of predicting temperature profiles during local hyperthermia treatment are very important to avoid damage to healthy tissue. With this aim, fundamental solutions of Pennes' bioheat equation are derived in rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates. The medium is idealised as isotropic with effective thermal properties. Temperature distributions due to space- and time-dependent heat sources are obtained by the solution method presented. Applications of the fundamental solutions are addressed with emphasis on a particular problem of Magnetic Fluid Hyperthermia (MFH) consisting of a thin shell of magnetic nanoparticles in the outer surface of a spherical solid tumour. It is observed from the solution of this particular problem that the temperature profiles are strongly dependent on the distribution of the magnetic nanoparticles within the tissue. An almost uniform temperature profile is obtained inside the tumour with little penetration of therapeutic temperatures to the outer region of healthy tissue. The fundamental solutions obtained can be used to develop boundary element methods to predict temperature profiles with more complicated geometries.},

abstract = {Recent developments in radiotherapy therapy demand high computation powers to solve challenging problems in a timely fashion in a clinical environment. The graphics processing unit (GPU), as an emerging high-performance computing platform, has been introduced to radiotherapy. It is particularly attractive due to its high computational power, small size, and low cost for facility deployment and maintenance. Over the past few years, GPU-based high-performance computing in radiotherapy has experienced rapid developments. A tremendous amount of study has been conducted, in which large acceleration factors compared with the conventional CPU platform have been observed. In this paper, we will first give a brief introduction to the GPU hardware structure and programming model. We will then review the current applications of GPU in major imaging-related and therapy-related problems encountered in radiotherapy. A comparison of GPU with other platforms will also be presented.},

abstract = {Hyperthermia treatment planning (HTP) is an important tool to improve the quality of hyperthermia treatment. It is a practical way of designing new hyperthermia systems and can be used to optimize the phase and amplitude settings to achieve optimal heating. One of the main challenges to be dealt with however is the uncertainty in the modeling parameters. The role of dielectric and combined dielectric and perfusion uncertainty on optimization was investigated by means of HTP for six different systems: the 70 MHz AMC-4 (AMC: Academic Medical Center) and AMC-8 system, a 130 MHz version of the AMC-8 system, a three-ring AMC-12 system operating at 130 MHz, the BSD SigmaEye applicator and a dipole applicator with three rings each containing six dipole pairs operated at 150 MHz. For five patients with cervix uteri carcinoma, a patient model was created based on a hyperthermia planning CT. Variation of tissue parameters resulted in 16 dielectric models for every patient. In addition, four thermal models were created to study the combined effect of perfusion and dielectric uncertainty. The impact of dielectric uncertainty on optimization is found to be clearly dependent on the number of channels and increased from 0.5 °C for four channels to 1.5 °C for the 18-channel system. As a result, the potential gain relative to the AMC-4 system for the 70 MHz AMC-8 system was found to be largely compromised, while for the remaining systems a robust improvement in T(90) was observed. The dipole applicator showed the best target heating for two out of five patients, while for three others heating efficacy was comparable to the 130 MHz AMC-12 system or the 130 MHz AMC-8 system (one patient). Considering the increase in complexity when the number of channels is increased from 12 to 18, the AMC-12 system is considered as a good compromise between heating efficacy and robustness while still being a manageable heating system in clinical practice.},

@article{Pickering1993,
abstract = {A system is described and evaluated for the simultaneous measurement of the intrinsic optical properties of tissue: the scattering coefficient, the absorption coefficient, and the anisotropy factor. This system synthesizes the theory of two integrating spheres and an intervening scattering sample with the inverse adding-doubling algorithm, which employs the adding-doubling solution of the radiative transfer equation to determine the optical properties from the measurement of the light flux within each sphere and of the unscattered transmission. The optical properties may be determined simultaneously, which allows for measurements to be made while the sample undergoes heating, chemical change, or some otherexternal stimulus. An experimental validation of the system with tissue phantoms resulted in the determination of the optical properties with a < 5\% deviation when the optical density was between 1 and 10 and the albedo was between 0.4 and 0.95.},

In this study, the optical properties of selected native and coagulated human brain structures were determined in vitro in the spectral range between 360 and 1100 nm. The tissues investigated included white brain matter, grey brain matter, cerebellum and brainstem tissues (pons, thalamus). In addition, the optical properties of two human tumours (meningioma, astrocytoma WHO grade II) were determined. Diffuse reflectance, total transmittance and collimated transmittance of the samples were measured using an integrating-sphere technique. From these experimental data, the absorption coefficients, the scattering coefficients and the anisotropy factors of the samples were determined employing an inverse Monte Carlo technique. The tissues investigated differed from each other predominantly in their scattering properties. Thermal coagulation reduced the optical penetration depth substantially. The highest penetration depths for all tissues investigated were found in the wavelength range between 1000 and 1100 nm. A comparison with data from the literature revealed the importance of the employed tissue preparation technique and the impact of the theoretical model used to extract the optical coefficients from the measured quantities.},

@article{Carp2004,
abstract = {Using the delta-P(1) approximation to the Boltzmann transport equation we develop analytic solutions for the fluence rate produced by planar (1-D) and Gaussian beam (2-D) irradiation of a homogeneous, turbid, semi-infinite medium. To assess the performance of these solutions we compare the predictions for the fluence rate and two metrics of the optical penetration depth with Monte Carlo simulations. We provide results under both refractive-index matched and mismatched conditions for optical properties where the ratio of reduced scattering to absorption lies in the range 0< or =(micro(s')/micro(a))< or =10(4). For planar irradiation, the delta-P(1) approximation provides fluence rate profiles accurate to +/-16\% for depths up to six transport mean free paths (l*) over the full range of optical properties. Metrics for optical penetration depth are predicted with an accuracy of +/-4\%. For Gaussian irradiation using beam radii r(0) > or =3 l*, the accuracy of the fluence rate predictions is no worse than in the planar irradiation case. For smaller beam radii, the predictions degrade significantly. Specifically for media with (micro(s')/micro(a))=1 irradiated with a beam radius of r(0)=l*, the error in the fluence rate approaches 100\%. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the optical penetration depth predictions remains excellent for Gaussian beam irradiation, and degrades to only +/-20\% for r(0)=l*. These results show that for a given set of optical properties (micro(s')/micro(a)), the optical penetration depth decreases with a reduction in the beam diameter. Graphs are provided to indicate the optical and geometrical conditions under which one must replace the delta-P(1) results for planar irradiation with those for Gaussian beam irradiation to maintain accurate dosimetry predictions.},

abstract = {The aim was to determine if water-cooled diffusing tips could produce larger and safer (better controlled) thermal lesions than non-cooled diffusing tips at 980 nm. Thermal lesions were induced in beef myocardium in vitro with and without water cooling using a 980 nm diode laser at various power levels. Seven intracerebral treatments were performed in six canines using water-cooled diffusing tips with four animals having intracerebral transmissible venereal tumours grown from inoculate. Magnetic resonance thermal imaging (MRTI)-based feedback software using a fast, radio frequency-spoiled gradient echo acquisition with two intersecting image planes was used for on-line monitoring and control of treatment and for the evaluation of in vivo laser lesion production. In cases where two-plane MRTI was employed, the maximum calculated temperature was compared in each plane. Using water-cooled tips and 400 micro m core diameter laser diffusing fibres in in vitro beef myocardium, power of up to 9.5 W was applied for 8 min without tip failure. Without cooling, tip failure occurred in under 4 min at 6 W, in under 2 min at 7 W and instantaneously at 8 W. Additionally, char accompanied lesions made with uncooled tips while cooled application resulted in only minimal char at only the highest thermal dose. Achieved lesion cross-sectional diameters in in vitro samples were up to 26.5 x 23.3 mm when water cooling was used. In canine brain and transmissible venereal tumours, up to 18.1 x 21.4 mm lesions were achieved. It is concluded that water cooling allows safe application of higher power to small core diameter diffusing tip fibres, which results in larger thermal lesions than can be achieved without cooling. Two-plane MRTI enhances on-line monitoring and feedback of thermal treatment.},

abstract = {In this work, we numerically investigated nanoparticle-assisted laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy for tumor/cancer treatments. The goal of the study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of treatment conditions including laser wavelength, power, exposure time, concentrations of tailored nanoparticles, and optical/thermal properties of the tissue that is under treatment. It was found that using absorbing preferential nanoparticles as the photothermal agent weakens fluence rate distributions in terms of lowering fluence rate peaks and reducing laser penetration depths. However, the local enhancement in laser photon absorption induced by nanoparticles is so significant that the reduced fluence rate will be balanced out, and the eventual medical hyperthermia is greatly prompted by using nanoparticles. Also, the results of numerical simulations indicated that with constant laser illumination, an increase in nanoparticle concentration beyond a certain range has only an insignificant impact on hyperthermia.},

abstract = {We report on a pilot study showing a proof of concept for the passive delivery of nanoshells to an orthotopic tumor where they induce a local, confined therapeutic response distinct from that of normal brain resulting in the photothermal ablation of canine transmissible venereal tumor (cTVT) in a canine brain model. cTVT fragments grown in severe combined immunodeficient mice were successfully inoculated in the parietal lobe of immunosuppressed, mixed-breed hound dogs. A single dose of near-IR (NIR)-absorbing, 150-nm nanoshells was infused i.v. and allowed time to passively accumulate in the intracranial tumors, which served as a proxy for an orthotopic brain metastasis. The nanoshells accumulated within the intracranial cTVT, suggesting that its neovasculature represented an interruption of the normal blood-brain barrier. Tumors were thermally ablated by percutaneous, optical fiber-delivered, NIR radiation using a 3.5-W average, 3-minute laser dose at 808 nm that selectively elevated the temperature of tumor tissue to 65.8 +/- 4.1 degrees C. Identical laser doses applied to normal white and gray matter on the contralateral side of the brain yielded sublethal temperatures of 48.6 +/- 1.1 degrees C. The laser dose was designed to minimize thermal damage to normal brain tissue in the absence of nanoshells and compensate for variability in the accumulation of nanoshells in tumor. Postmortem histopathology of treated brain sections showed the effectiveness and selectivity of the nanoshell-assisted thermal ablation.},

abstract = {Four models, standard diffusion approximation (SDA), single Monte Carlo (SMC), delta-P1, and isotropic similarity (ISM), are developed and evaluated as forward calculation tools in the estimation of tissue optical properties. The inverse calculation uses the ratio of the fluences and phase difference at two locations close to an intensity modulated isotropic source to recover the reduced scattering coefficient mus' and the absorption coefficient mua. Diffusion theory allows recovery of optical properties (OPs) within 5\% for media with mus'mua>10. The performance of the delta-P1 model is similar to SDA, with limited enhanced accuracy. The collimation approximation may limit the use of the delta-P1 model for spherical geometry, and/or the fluence may not be accurately calculated by this model. The SMC model is the best, recovering OPs within 10\% regardless of the albedo. However, the necessary restriction of the searched OPs space is inconvenient. The performance of ISM is similar to that of diffusion theory for media with mus'mua>10, and better for 1<mus'mua<10, i.e., determines absorption within 5\% and reduced scattering within 20\%. In practice, satisfactory estimates (within 5 to 10\%) can be achieved using SDA to recover mus' and ISM to recover mua for media with mus'mua>5.},

abstract = {Laser Interstitial ThermoTherapy (LITT) is a well established surgical method. The use of LITT is so far limited to homogeneous tissues, e.g. the liver. One of the reasons is the limited capability of existing treatment planning models to calculate accurately the damage zone. The treatment planning in inhomogeneous tissues, especially of regions near main vessels, poses still a challenge. In order to extend the application of LITT to a wider range of anatomical regions new simulation methods are needed. The model described with this article enables efficient simulation for predicting damaged tissue as a basis for a future laser-surgical planning system. Previously we described the dependency of the model on geometry. With the presented paper including two video files we focus on the methodological, physical and mathematical background of the model.},

abstract = {In certain clinical situations, such as photodynamic therapy, light dosimetry should be considered. The propagation of light in tissues is influenced by fundamental or microscopic optical properties, namely absorption mu a and scattering mu s coefficients, refractive index n and anistropy factor g. These optical parameters can be determined experimentally by direct and/or indirect methods when tissue macroscopic properties, such as reflectance, transmittance or collimated transmittance from a tissue slab, are measured. The method described in this work provides graphical, and in simple cases analytical, 'inverse' solutions to determine tissue microscopic properties from measured macroscopic parameters. The graphs necessary for this inversion have been calculated and are provided. The method can be applied in either direct or indirect techniques and it does not depend on limitations introduced by assumptions and approximations when using theoretical models. It can also be applied for any tissue type, detector geometry and experimental apparatus. The accuracy of the method is very good over a wide range, unlimited in practice, of values of optical properties. Finally, the results of this work are in good agreement with theoretical and experimental results of other investigators.},

Although it is known that the background field satisfies Laplace's equation, the boundary values of the background field for the region of interest have not been explicitly addressed in the existing methods, and they are not directly available from MRI measurements. In this paper, we assume simple boundary conditions and remove the background field by explicitly solving the boundary value problems of Laplace's or Poisson's equation. The proposed Laplacian boundary value (LBV) method for background field removal retains data near the boundary and is computationally efficient. Tests on a numerical phantom and an experimental phantom showed that LBV was more accurate than two existing methods.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The number of older patients with epilepsy has been increasing steadily, however older adults have been shown to be referred less commonly to specialist epilepsy services than younger individuals. The aim of this study was to explore staff perceptions of why older adults may be under-represented in epilepsy clinics.

METHOD: We conducted 19 interviews with potential referrers and staff providing services including GPs, geriatricians, neurologists, service and clinical managers and epilepsy nurses. Data were analysed using principles of thematic analysis to identify and examine recurring views and perceptions.

RESULTS: Seven key factors were suggested as leading to under-referral of older adults: patient difficulties accessing hospital; patient reluctance to attend clinics; unclear referral pathway; complex differential diagnosis; gaps in referrer knowledge; the length of time since onset; and particular characteristics of older patients.

CONCLUSION: While recognising the limitations of the study we believe that it provides valuable further understanding of referral patterns to specialist epilepsy services. Future studies will need to determine whether the assumptions made by the interviewees about the thoughts and wishes of older people with epilepsy were correct or not. To understand this issue more clearly, we plan to sample the views of patients directly. Of particular concern are assumptions regarding older patient's willingness to attend appointments and about the impact of seizures on the life of an older adult.},

abstract = {A novel robust and user friendly method for post-processing dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI data is presented, which provides reliable real-time delineation of the borders of thermal ablation lesions on low SNR images shortly after contrast agent injection without any model-based curve fittierapy (LITT) is a procedure for intracranial tumors. Minimal data exists regarding post-procedure lesion volume changes.

OBJECTIVES: We aim to analyze changes in lesion volume during the post-LITT period using polygonal tracing with fusion. Additionally, we investigated the role of lesion histopathology on LITT parameters and volume dynamics.

METHODS: Sixteen patients with intracranial neoplasms received LITT. Using OsiriX DICOM Viewer, three raters computed lesion volumes at the following: pre-ablation (PreA), immediate post-ablation (IPA), 24 hours post-ablation (24PA), and first follow-up post-ablation (FPA), which ranged from 4 to 11 weeks post-ablation. Statistical analyses for volume changes between time points and inter-rater reliability were performed. Additionally, comparisons were made between metastatic versus non-metastatic and small versus large lesions in terms of operative parameters and volume changes.

RESULTS: There was an acute increase in volume at IPA with a decrease in size by 24PA. ANOVA among inter-rater datasets showed no significant difference at any time point (highest F(1,15)  = 0.225, P > 0.80, for IPA). GLM repeated measures, for Intra-Rater analysis, demonstrated statistically significant differences across time points (lowest F(1,15)  = 13.297, P = 0.003). IPA volumes were larger than those at PreA, 24PA, and FPA (average volume increase [95\% CI]: 281\% [157-404\%], 167\% [134-201\%], 187\% [154-219\%], respectively; all P < 0.004). Correlation analysis showed lower inter-rater reliability at IPA versus other time points (all P < 0.03). Larger lesions (>2.5 cm³ ) versus smaller (<2.5 cm³ ) did not demonstrate a difference in percent volume increase. Operative parameters and volume dynamics were not different between metastatic and non-metastatic groups.

CONCLUSIONS: The response of intracranial lesions to LITT demonstrates a peak in volume at the IPA time point with decreased IPA inter-rater reliability. We recommend that conclusions about intracranial lesion size post-LITT be made at least 24 hours post-LITT rather than immediately after LITT.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery is often an effective tool for the treatment of brain metastases. A complication of radiosurgical treatment for brain metastasis can be persistent cerebral edema. Treatments of this refractory cerebral edema include observation, corticosteroids, and surgical resection of the edema-inducing mass. Laser-interstitial thermal therapy is a minimally invasive technique for ablating intracranial lesions. It may provide a treatment option for metastases after radiosurgery causing refractory cerebral edema.

CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 64-year-old man with lung adenocarcinoma presenting to our department with left hemiparesis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed an 18-mm enhancing lesion in the right external capsule with significanve morbidity rates by hospital surgical volume.

RESULTS: The number of lobectomies for epilepsy performed at high-volume centers (> 15 lobectomies/year) significantly decreased between 1990 and 2008 (F = 20.4, p < 0.001), while significantly more procedures were performed at middle-volume hospitals (5-15 lobectomies/year) over time (F = 16.1, p < 0.001). No time trend was observed for hospitals performing fewer than 5 procedures per year. However, patients admitted to high-volume centers were significantly more likely to receive lobectomy than those at low-volume hospitals (relative risk 1.05, 95\% CI 1.03-1.08, p < 0.001). Also, the incidence of perioperative adverse events was significantly higher at low-volume hospitals (12.9\%) than at high-volume centers (6.1\%) (relative risk 1.08, 95\% CI 1.03-1.07, p < 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: Hospital volume is an important predictor of epilepsy surgery utilization and perioperative morbidity. Patients with medically refractory epilepsy should be referred to a comprehensive epilepsy treatment center for surgical evaluation by an experienced clinical team.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Despite advances in "noninvasive" localization techniques, many patients with medically intractable epilepsy require the placement of subdural (subdural grid electrode, SDE) and/or depth electrodes for the identification and definition of extent of the epileptic region. This study investigates the trends in longitudinal seizure outcome and its predictors in this group.

METHODS: We reviewed the medical records, and electroencephalography (EEG) data of 414 consecutive patients who underwent intracranial electrode placement (SDE and/or depth electrodes) at Cleveland Clinic Epilepsy Center between 1998 and 2008. A favorable outcome was defined as complete seizure freedom, discounting any auras or seizures that occurred within the first postoperative week. Survival curves were constructed, and Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to identify outcome predictors.

KEY FINDINGS: The estimated probability of complete seizure freedom was 61\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 58-64\%) at one postoperative year, 47\% (95\% CI 44-50\%) at 3 years, 42\% (95\% CI 39-45\%) at 5 years, and 33\% (95\% CI 28-38\%) at 10 years. Half of all seizure recurrences occurred within the first two postoperative months. Subsequently, the rate of seizure freedom declined by 4-5\% every 2-3 years. After multivariate analysis, two independent predictors of seizure recurrence were identified: (1) prior resective surgery (p ≤ 0.002), mostly in patients with temporal lobe resections, and (2) sublobar or multilobar resection (p ≤ 0.02), mostly in patients following frontal lobe resections.

SIGNIFICANCE: Favorable seizure outcomes are possible in the complex epilepsy population requiring invasive EEG studies.

abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Thermal coagulation of cerebral tumors induces reactive changes within adjacent brain tissue, which appear as Gd-DTPA enhancement in MR images. This makes assessment of therapeutic success difficult to establish radiographically because the reactive changes can mimic residual tumor. Dynamic Gd-DTPA uptake curves in reactive tissue and tumor were investigated to assess the utility of contrast enhanced (CE)-dynamic MRI to distinguish reactive changes from residual tumor in a canine model.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cerebral thermal necrosis was induced using a 980 nm laser in 11 dogs with intracerebral transmissible venereal tumors (TVTs). A fast spin-echo T1-weighted imaging sequence was used for CE-dynamic MRI. Gd-DTPA uptake data were acquired with 10-second temporal resolution and for untreated TVTs for reactive tissue using a sigmoidal-exponential model.

RESULTS: Characteristic gadolinium uptake curves were measured and characterized for reactive brain tissue, and untreated and treated TVTs. Both early and delayed dynamic responses were significantly different in reactive brain tissue compared with TVT.

CONCLUSION: Reactive thermal changes in otherwise normal brain tissue can be distinguished from residual tumor after cerebral thermal therapy using CE-dynamic MRI.},

It is shown how predictive accuracy depends on sample size and the number of predictor variables. Both two-sample and single-sample cross-validation indices are investigated. The application of cross-validation methods to the analysis of moment structures is then justified. An equivalence of a single-sample cross-validation index and the Akaike information criterion is pointed out. It is seen that the optimal number of parameters suggested by both single-sample and two-sample cross-validation indices will depend on sample size. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

@article{Curry2012,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: For about 30\% of epilepsy patients, pharmaceutical therapy fails to control their seizures. MR-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT) allows for real-time thermal monitoring of the ablation process and feedback control over the laser energy delivery. We report on minimally invasive surgical techniques of MRgLITT and short-term follow-up results from the first five pediatric cases in which this system was used to ablate focal epileptic lesions.

METHODS: We studied the patients with MRI of the brain, localized the seizure with video-EEG and used the Visualase Thermal Therapy 25 System for laser ablation of their seizure foci.

RESULTS: All 5 patients are seizure free and there were no complications as of 2-13-month follow-up.

CONCLUSION: MR-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy has a significant potential to be a minimally invasive alternative to more conventional techniques to surgically treat medically refractory epilepsy in children.},

abstract = {Metastatic tumours involving the brain overshadow primary brain neoplasms in frequency and are an important complication in the overall management of many cancers. Importantly, advances are being made in understanding the molecular biology underlying the initial development and eventual proliferation of brain metastases. Surgery and radiation remain the cornerstones of the therapy for symptomatic lesions; however, image-based guidance is improving surgical technique to maximize the preservation of normal tissue, while more sophisticated approaches to radiation therapy are being used to minimize the long-standing concerns over the toxicity of whole-brain radiation protocols used in the past. Furthermore, the burgeoning knowledge of tumour biology has facilitated the entry of systemically administered therapies into the clinic. Responses to these targeted interventions have ranged from substantial toxicity with no control of disease to periods of useful tumour control with no decrement in performance status of the treated individual. This experience enables recognition of the limits of targeted therapy, but has also informed methods to optimize this approach. This Review focuses on the clinically relevant molecular biology of brain metastases, and summarizes the current applications of these data to imaging, surgery, radiation therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapy.},

abstract = {In this article we prove sanity-check bounds for the error of the leave-oneout cross-validation estimate of the generalization error: that is, bounds showing that the worst-case error of this estimate is not much worse than that of the training error estimate. The name sanity check refers to the fact that although we often expect the leave-one-out estimate to perform considerably better than the training error estimate, we are here only seeking assurance that its performance will not be considerably worse. Perhaps surprisingly, such assurance has been given only for limited cases in the prior literature on cross-validation. Any nontrivial bound on the error of leave-one-out must rely on some notion of algorithmic stability. Previous bounds relied on the rather strong notion of hypothesis stability, whose application was primarily limited to nearest-neighbor and other local algorithms. Here we introduce the new and weaker notion of error stability and apply it to obtain sanity-check bounds for leave-one-ou...},

@article{Schutt2008,
abstract = {Purpose: Finite element method (FEM) models are commonly used to simulate radio frequency (RF) tumor ablation. Prior FEM models of RF ablation have either ignored the temperature dependent effect of microvascular perfusion, or implemented the effect using simplified algorithms to reduce computational complexity. In this FEM modeling study, the authors compared the effect of different microvascular perfusion algorithms on ablation zone dimensions with two commercial RF electrodes in hepatic tissue. They also examine the effect of tissue type and inter-patient variation of perfusion on ablation zone dimensions. Methods and Materials: The authors created FEM models of an internally cooled and multi-tined expandable electrode. RF voltage was applied to both electrodes (for 12 or 15 min, respectively) such that the maximum temperature in the model was 105 °C. Temperature dependent microvascular perfusion was implemented using three previously reported methodologies: cessation above 60 °C, a standard first-order Arrhenius model with decreasing perfusion with increasing degree of vascular stasis, and an Arrhenius model that included the effects of increasing perfusion at the ablation zone boundary due to hyperemia. To examine the effects of interpatient variation, simulations were performed with base line and ±1 standard deviation values of perfusion. The base line perfusion was also varied to simulate the difference between normal and cirrhotic liver tissue. Results: The ablation zone volumes with the cessation above 60 °C perfusion algorithm and with the more complex Arrhenius model were up to 70\% and 25\% smaller, respectively, compared to the standard Arrhenius model. Ablation zone volumes were up to ∼175\% and ∼100\% different between the simulations where −1 and +1 standard deviation values of perfusion were used in normal and cirrhotic liver tissue, respectively. Conclusions: The choice of microvascular perfusion algorithm has significant effects on final ablation zone dimensions in FEM models of RF ablation. The authors also found that both interpatient variation in base line tissue perfusion and the reduction in perfusion due to cirrhosis have considerable effect on ablation zone dimensions.},
